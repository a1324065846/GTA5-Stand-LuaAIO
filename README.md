## Advantages Of The Collection

1.**core benefits** unlock all GT function\
2.eliminate the tedious steps of downloading each lua individually,all the lua has been dragged into the entire warehouse,download and unzip it to use\
3.all library files for stand have been downloaded in advance,lua scripts will no longer pop up when selected"please wait"notice,any lua can be opened without waiting\
4.including stand major domestic and foreign lua,there is no need to search for groups or people one by one,dramatically reduces the time it takes to experience different lua\

## easy installation tutorial

[click here to automatically start downloading the lua collection](https://github.com/xhcherry/GTA5-Stand-LuaAIO/archive/refs/heads/English.zip)\
wait for the download to complete and extract the downloaded archive completely(**it is decompressed not directly opened the compressed package**),drag all the files in the folder to the stand directory\
**it is recommended for players who do not have a fixed computer to play the game**,this requires frequent re downloads of more than 200 mb of the archive and full decompression,it s time consuming

## Install The Tutorial Once And For All

this tutorial will teach you how to configure a complete repository environment,and clone the standlua of the repository to the local computer,it s extremely convenient to use this tutorial for future updates\
[complete the configuration tutorial of the standlua collection repository in one go](https://github.com/xhcherry/GTA5-Stand-LuaAIO/wiki/lua安装教程)\
**it is recommended for players who play on a stationary computer**,only the first configuration trouble,after a subsequent repository update,players who use this tutorial only need to press four times to complete the update,and the update is fast,there is no need to re download and unzip

## Questions Answers

if you have any questions about the stand ontology or the use of lua you can ask questions[issues](https://github.com/xhcherry/GTA5-Stand-LuaAIO/issues)

if you have a good lua and want to join the collection repository contact me via discord

this wiki contains descriptions of stands,and all sorts of typical questions will be here

# How To Systematically Learn A Programming Language

## 1.The Basic Grammar Of The Language
1 what are the data types

2 how to write a loop

3 how arrays are defined

4 how to write functions

once you ve completed this stage you ll be able to understand the code,simple secondary development is also possible
## 2.Implement The Underlying Data Structure In This Language
sequential table,skewer,linked lists,stack,queue,tree,binary tree,binary search tree,fig,adjacency matrices,adjacency table,hash table
## 3.Use This Language To Brush The Basic Algorithms
it can improve programming thinking and problem solving skills

algorithm：linear enumeration,sort,Mock,cupidity,binary enumeration,deep search,search widely

enhanced algorithms：dynamic programming,the shortest path,minimal spanning tree
## 4.Combat Projects
it is possible to implement a game or software

difficulty to learn：python ≈ lua < java < C++ < C
